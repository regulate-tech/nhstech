UK health and care sector ICT survey tools

This repository hosts a project set up by RTFM Club to map out information and communications technologies (ICTs) being used within the UK health and care sectors.

The goal of this project is to provide useful information for people making decisions about which ICTs to buy and deploy in these sectors.

There are a number of sources of data which will be described here along with any software tools that are needed to obtain and format the collected data.
