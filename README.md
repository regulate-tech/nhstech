UK health and care sector ICT survey tools

This repository hosts a project set up by RTFM Club to map out information and communications technologies (ICTs) being used within the UK health and care sectors.

The goal of this project is to provide useful information for people making decisions about which ICTs to buy and deploy in these sectors.

There are a number of sources of data which will be described here along with any software tools that are needed to obtain and format the collected data.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
Git for your platform - https://github.com/git-guides/install-git
Python for your platform - https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Configuration

Once you have Git installed, you can clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/regulate-tech/nhstech

You will now have a local copy of the file structure in the directory where you ran the 'git clone' command.

You can navigate to each sub-directory to run any python scripts they contain following any setup instructions in a config.md file.

In most cases, it is a good idea to setup a virtual environment that has been configured to run a set of scripts. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html
