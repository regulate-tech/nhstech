    "# 2. Add other relevant data: EPR suppliers and trust populations\n",

    "This notebook joins our tidy ERIC data with other relevant datasets: EPR suppliers, and trust catchment populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Richard has obtained data on the primary EPR (electronic patient record) supplier to each NHS primary trust, as of January 2024; and also on trust catchment populations. This notebook does some exploratory analysis on those datasets, and then joins them to the ERIC data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations on the EPR suppliers data:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are 209 trusts of which 135 are acute, 10 ambulance, 18 mental health, 13 community, and 33 combined mental health & community.\n",
    "- These trusts between them use 24 different EPR suppliers; the suppliers are mostly different depending on the type of trust.\n",
    "- In acute trusts, Oracle Cerner is the most widely (and only) used by acute trusts, and surprisingly 20 acute trusts don't have an EPR as of Jan 2024.\n",
    "- Mental health and community trusts all have EPRs, and are dominated by TPP and The Access Group.\n",
    "- The market is fairly concentrated in these big suppliers, but still there are quite a few small suppliers, across all types of trust.\n",
    "- This data also tells us trust type, and includes only active trusts (and seems to be a more reliable source of active status than the NHS ODS data)"
