# NHSTech - Project Paperless

## Goal

A set of notebooks to collect and analyse data on the cost of storing medical records in the UK NHS.

## Context


- The NHS has committed to replacing expensive paper records with lower-cost digital records several times, but often this has not happened.
- We can get a sense of the persistence of such records by looking at the amounts NHS Trusts say they are spending on medical records storage in an annual estates return they are required to make.
- All NHS Trusts have to complete an annual return for their estate costs which includes data on medical records costs - this is called [the ERIC return](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/estates-returns-information-collection).

## Questions

We want to know: 

- How much is being spent by each NHS Trust on storing medical records?
- How is the expenditure on changing over time?
- How does this look at individual trust level?
- Can we correlate this expenditure with information about electronic patient records?
- Is there any other information that helps explain the varying cost of medical records across Trusts?

## Outputs

A simple analysis of this data allows us to see the overall trends in expenditure and the state of play for each Trust.

We can show this overall picture in a series of bar charts showing the amounts recorded in each annual return.

There is site level data allowing for a more detailed analysis and we can cross-reference this information with data about the adoption of electronic health records systems.

## Usage

The simplest way to explore the data is to run the notebooks.

You can also explore the interactive output via the `docs` directory.
