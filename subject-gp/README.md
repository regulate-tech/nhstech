# NHSTech - Project Paper

## Goal

A set of tools to analyse the market for ICTs being used in General Practice (GP) in the UK.

## Context

People's interactions with GPs are a key part of their experience accessing medical services in the UK.

General Practices are mostly small private businesses who work to a contract for supplying services to the NHS.

There is a long-standing arrangement for GPs to buy their own ICTs within arrangements for reimbursement that have evolved over the years.

## Questions

How much is being spent by GPs on ICTs?
What does the market for supplying ICTs to GPs look like?
How effective are the systems that GPs are buying?
Where are there gaps and where is there duplication?

## Outputs

A dataset showing the range of systems being used by each GP and analyses that help us understand the supplier base and usage of their systems.

Subsequent areas for detailed analysis will be developed once we have the picture from the initial assessment of the state of the market.

## Usage

We will use some of the project's core tools to create the GP directory dataset.

We will produce notebooks for the areas of analysis.
