# Tools to understand the health & care system

Mapping the digital systems used within the UK health and care sectors to tackle the interoperability gap, highlight what is working, and demonstrate what better looks like.

We provide clear analyses of what is already in use &ndash; _the good, the bad and the ugly_ &ndash; to help improve decision making.

For example, our [Paperless NHS report](paperless.html) shows the NHS spends **£250 million a year** on storing and handling paper medical records, and that total is going up.


## What’s the big idea?

You know the story. We all carry supercomputers in our pockets, making it easy to share cat videos or order a taxi in seconds. That tech is fast, cheap, and simple.

> The technology we use when engaging with or working in health and care should be at least as good as the technology we use to share cat videos.

So why, when a nurse tries to check a patient record, are they fighting with a system that feels like a clunky, overpriced Nokia from twenty years ago? It’s absurd. Public services end up with slow, baffling tech that staff hate using, and taxpayers pay a fortune for it.

We are working on more tools to help comprehend the structure of the health and care system.
