> The technology people use when they engage with or work in health and care should be at least as good as the technology we use to share cat videos.


This project set up by [RTFM Club](https://rtfmclub.com/) will map out information and communications technologies (ICTs) being used within the UK health and care sectors.

We hope that some good analyses of what is already in use - the good, the bad and the ugly - will help improve decision-making and so move us towards this goal.

We published output from our initial project during November and December 2024. This is an analysis of spending by NHS Trusts in England on storing medical records - [read about it here](paperless.html).

We are now working on more tools to help with understanding the structure of the health and care system.
