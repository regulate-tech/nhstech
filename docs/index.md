# NHSTech

A project set up by [RTFM Club](https://rtfmclub.com/) to map out information and communications technologies (ICTs) being used within the UK health and care sectors.

We are doing this work because we think that the technology people use when they work in or need to access health and care should be at least as good as the technology we use to share cat videos.  

We hope that some good analyses of what is already in use - the good, the bad and the ugly - will help improve decision-making and so move us towards this goal.

We have been working on our initial project during November and December 2024. This is an analysis of spending by NHS Trusts in England on storing medical records - [read about it here](paperless.html).

Our next release is planned for February 2025 when we will be sharing some tools that can help with understanding the structure of the health and care system.
