# NHSTech Project Paper

A set of tools to collect and analyse data on the use of paper-based medical records in the UK NHS.

There have been various initiatives to make the NHS 'paperless' over the years but paper medical records are still in widespread use.

We can get a sense of the persistence of paper records by looking at the amounts NHS Trusts say they are spending on medical records storage in an annual estates return they are required to make.

A simple analysis of this data allows us to see the overall trends in expenditure and the state of play for each Trust.

There is site level data allowing for a more detailed analysis and we can cross-reference this information with data about the adoption of electronic health records systems.

## Usage

The simplest way to explore the data is to make a copy of the notebook (nhstech_project_paper.ipynb) in Google Colab.

You can also make a local copy if you use Jupyter on your own machine or just copy out the Python code.
